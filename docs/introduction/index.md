# Introduction to GLAMpipe

## Background

The initial development was funded by Wikimedia Foundation grant in 2016. GLAMpipe was designed to be alternative for GlamWikiToolset for commons uploads.

The project was practically dead couple of years due time constaints, but it is now actively developed.


## What propblem GLAMpipe tries to solve?

GLAMpipe wants to be a simple, but extremely flexible tool for data browsing and transformations. In order to achieve this, GLAMpipe applies onion model for its user experience. 


 - **Simple and intuitive** graphical user interface for all users
 - **Scripting** supported in GUI for those who know a little bit javascript
 - **REST API** for programmers
 - **Software library** for (really interested) programmers



For a developer, there is nothing more annoying than a graphical user interface that *almost* do the thing that you wanted without possibility to go around it. 


## Terminology

GLAMpipe is based on object database called MongoDB. Correspondense between spreadsheets and GLAMpipe is that row in sheet is a document in GLAMpipe.
